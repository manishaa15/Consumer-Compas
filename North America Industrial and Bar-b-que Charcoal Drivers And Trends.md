<p> <h2>North America Industrial and Bar-b-que Charcoal Market Drivers and Trends</h2><p>The growing popularity of outdoor grilling and BBQ culture in North America is a key driver for the charcoal market.

Beyond household grilling, charcoal is widely used in industries like metallurgy, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals due to its high calorific value and versatility. Growing awareness about the environmental impact of alternative fuels has pushed industries toward charcoal as a cleaner, renewable energy source.
