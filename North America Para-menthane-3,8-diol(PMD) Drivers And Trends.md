<p> <h2>North America Para-menthane-3,8-diol (PMD) Market Driver and Trends</h2><p>One of the key drivers for the growth of the North American para-menthane-3,8-diol (PMD) market is the increasing consumer preference for natural and effective insect repellents. PMD, derived from the eucalyptus plant, is gaining popularity as a safer, plant-based alternative to synthetic chemicals like DEET. As consumers become more conscious of the environmental and health impacts of traditional repellents, demand for PMD-based products continues to rise. This shift is particularly evident in the personal care, wellness, and outdoor recreation sectors, where consumers seek non-toxic options for pest protection.</p><p>In addition, rising awareness about the risks associated with vector-borne diseases such as Lyme disease, West Nile virus, and Zika virus is fueling demand for effective insect repellents. As these diseases become more prevalent in North America, individuals and public health organizations are increasingly turning to PMD as a reliable solution. Furthermore, regulatory support for natural ingredients in consumer products is driving innovation and product development, creating new opportunities for market expansion. As a result, the PMD market is experiencing steady growth, driven by both health concerns and consumer preferences for eco-friendly alternatives.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=483396&utm_source=GitHub-Jan&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">North AmericaPara-menthane-3,8-diol(PMD) Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;North AmericaPara-menthane-3,8-diol(PMD) Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Para-menthane-3,8-diol(PMD) Market size was valued at USD 0.32 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 0.58 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.9% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;North AmericaPara-menthane-3,8-diol(PMD) Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Citrefine International Limited</Li><Li> Wisconsin Pharmacal Inc</Li><Li> Beyond IndustriesChina</Li><Li> Nanning Venusson Bio-Technology Co.
